# DIU-STUDENT-ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM

The DIU Student Attendance System is an automated android app for taking students’ attendance. It also greatly reduces the amount of paper resources needed in attendance data management. The system works in different mode. The student may have their ID card or not. In the case of having ID card a bar code scanner will be used for taking the attendance. For other case faculty will be able to take attendance by manually.

Registered students list can be founded from ERP system. At the end of course, faculty will be able to get total attendance sheet.

It allows user to create a student attendance sheet consisting of name, ID number, date, Absent/Present mark and subject. Faculty will be able to take attendance by scanning ID card. Faculty can be able send attendance sheet to him or her Email.

Faculty can be able to see total attendance in many graphical view like bar chart monthly of daily. Faculty can be able see a students’ absence or presence of certain threshold and can be founded the students who are present or absent in a certain time. At the end of a course the faculty can print his/her attendance sheet or can get Excel file of the sheet. 

Thus, this system automates attendance system and eliminates the use of paperwork needed for attendance marking and monitoring student attendance.
